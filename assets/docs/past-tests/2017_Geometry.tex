\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $ABC$ be a triangle with $\angle BAC=117^\circ$.  The angle bisector of $\angle ABC$ intersects side $AC$ at $D$.  Suppose $\triangle ABD\sim\triangle ACB$.  Compute the measure of $\angle ABC$, in degrees.

\item Triangle $ABC$ has an obtuse angle at $\angle A$.  Points $D$ and $E$ are placed on $\overline{BC}$ in the order $B$, $D$, $E$, $C$ such that $\angle BAD=\angle BCA$ and $\angle CAE=\angle CBA$.  If $AB=10$, $AC=11$, and $DE=4$, determine $BC$.

\item In acute triangle $ABC$, points $D$ and $E$ are the feet of the angle bisector and altitude from $A$ respectively.  Suppose that $AC - AB = 36$ and $DC - DB = 24$.  Compute $EC - EB$.

\item Let $\mathcal S$ be the sphere with center $(0,0,1)$ and radius $1$ in $\mathbb R^3$.  A plane $\mathcal P$ is tangent to $\mathcal S$ at the point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, where $x_0$, $y_0$, and $z_0$ are all positive.  Suppose the intersection of plane $\mathcal P$ with the $xy$-plane is the line with equation $2x+y=10$ in $xy$-space.  What is $z_0$?

\item Two circles $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are said to be $\textit{orthogonal}$ if they intersect each other at right angles.  In other words, for any point $P$ lying on both $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, if $\ell_1$ is the line tangent to $\omega_1$ at $P$ and $\ell_2$ is the line tangent to $\omega_2$ at $P$, then $\ell_1\perp \ell_2$.  (Two circles which do not intersect are not orthogonal.)

\par Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle with area $20$.  Orthogonal circles $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ are drawn with $\omega_B$ centered at $B$ and $\omega_C$ centered at $C$.  Points $T_B$ and $T_C$ are placed on $\omega_B$ and $\omega_C$ respectively such that $AT_B$ is tangent to $\omega_B$ and $AT_C$ is tangent to $\omega_C$.  If $AT_B = 7$ and $AT_C = 11$, what is $\tan\angle BAC$?

\item Cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ satisfies $\angle ABD = 70^\circ$, $\angle ADB=50^\circ$, and $BC=CD$.  Suppose $AB$ intersects $CD$ at point $P$, while $AD$ intersects $BC$ at point $Q$.  Compute $\angle APQ-\angle AQP$.

\item Two non-intersecting circles, $\omega$ and $\Omega$, have centers $C_\omega$ and $C_\Omega$ respectively.  It is given that the radius of $\Omega$ is strictly larger than the radius of $\omega$.  The two common external tangents of $\Omega$ and $\omega$ intersect at a point $P$, and an internal tangent of the two circles intersects the common external tangents at $X$ and $Y$.  Suppose that the radius of $\omega$ is $4$, the circumradius of $\triangle PXY$ is $9$, and $XY$ bisects $\overline{PC_\Omega}$.  Compute $XY$.

\item In triangle $ABC$ with $AB=23$, $AC=27$, and $BC=20$, let $D$ be the foot of the $A$ altitude.  Let $\mathcal{P}$ be the parabola with focus $A$ passing through $B$ and $C$, and denote by $T$ the intersection point of $AD$ with the directrix of $\mathcal P$.  Determine the value of $DT^2-DA^2$. (Recall that a parabola $\mathcal P$ is the set of points which are equidistant from a point, called the \textit{focus} of $\mathcal P$, and a line, called the \textit{directrix} of $\mathcal P$.)

\item Let $\triangle ABC$ be an acute triangle with circumcenter $O$, and let $Q\neq A$ denote the point on $\odot (ABC)$ for which $AQ\perp BC$. The circumcircle of $\triangle BOC$ intersects lines $AC$ and $AB$ for the second time at $D$ and $E$ respectively. Suppose that $AQ$, $BC$, and $DE$ are concurrent. If $OD=3$ and $OE=7$, compute $AQ$.

\item Suppose $\triangle ABC$ is such that $AB=13$, $AC=15$, and $BC=14$.  It is given that there exists a unique point $D$ on side $\overline{BC}$ such that the Euler lines of $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle ACD$ are parallel.  Determine the value of $\tfrac{BD}{CD}$.  (The \textit{Euler} line of a triangle $ABC$ is the line connecting the centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter of $ABC$.)

%\item Triangle $ABC$ has incircle $\omega$, circumcircle $\Omega$, and circumcenter $O$.  A line $\ell$ tangent to $\omega$ at $T$ perpendicular to $AO$ intersects $\Omega$ at two distinct points $X$ and $Y$.  Supppose that the radius of $\omega$ is $4$, the radius of $\Omega$ is $9$, and $TX\cdot TY = 48$.  Compute the area of $\triangle ABC$.

\item Among the vertices of a cube in $\mathbb R^3$, one has $z$-coordinate zero, one has $z$-coordinate $2016$, three have $z$-coordinate $z_1$, and three have $z$-coordinate $z_2$, where $0<z_1<z_2<2016$.  Find $z_1$.

\proposed{Phillip Wang}

\solution Scale down by a factor of $2016$.  Note that if $B$, $C$, and $D$ are the vertices of the cube adjacent to a vertex $A$, then $z_1$ is the distance from $A$ to the plane formed by $BCD$.  Remark that since the space diagonal of the cube has $1$, the side length of the cube is $\tfrac1{\sqrt 3}$.

\par Now let $E$ be the vertex diametrically opposite $A$.  We claim that $AE$ is perpendicular to the plane $BCD$.  To see this, we need a lemma.\\
\\
\textbf{LEMMA: }Let $SABC$ be a tetrahedron with $SA=SB=SC$.  Then the perpendicular from $S$ to the plane containing $A$, $B$, and $C$ intersects said plane at the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$.

\begin{proof}Let $O_1$ be the foot of the projection from $S$ to $\triangle ABC$. Then if $SA=SB=SC=s$, one can easily show that \[O_1A=O_1B=O_1C=\sqrt{s^2-O_1S^2},\] so $O_1$ is the circumcenter of $\triangle ABC$ as desired.\end{proof}

Now it is easy to see that $AB=AC=AD$ and $EB=EC=ED$, so the perpendiculars from $A$ and $E$ to $BCD$ coincide, i.e. $AE$ is perpendicular to plane $BCD$.

\par Finally, note that $\triangle BCD$ is an equilateral triangle of side length $\sqrt{\frac 23}$, and thus has area $\tfrac{\sqrt 3}6$.  Thus, the distance $d$ from $A$ to $BCD$ satisfies \[\dfrac13\cdot\dfrac{\sqrt 3}6d = [ABCD] = \dfrac{\sqrt 3}{54}\quad\implies\quad d = \frac13.\] Scaling back up yields a final answer of $\boxed{672}$.

Triangle $ABC$ has incircle $\omega$, circumcircle $\Omega$, and circumcenter $O$.  A line $\ell$ tangent to $\omega$ at $T$ perpendicular to $AO$ intersects $\Omega$ at two distinct points $X$ and $Y$.  Supppose that the radius of $\omega$ is $4$, the radius of $\Omega$ is $9$, and $TX\cdot TY = 48$.  Compute the area of $\triangle ABC$.

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Throughout this solution, we use standard triangle notation, so that $K$ is the area of $\triangle ABC$, $R$ is its circumradius, and so on.

\par Let $M$ denote the midpoint of $\overline{XY}$.  Note that by Power of a Point, \begin{align*}TX\cdot TY&=R^2 - OT^2\\&=R^2 - (MT^2+TO^2)\\&=R^2-\left(OI^2-(OM-r)^2\right) - OM^2\\&=R^2-OI^2+(OM-r)^2-OM^2\\&=R^2-(R^2-2Rr)+(OM^2-2OM\cdot r+r^2)-OM^2\\&=2Rr - 2OM\cdot r + r^2.\end{align*}  Setting this equal to $48$ and solving yields $OM = 5$, and since $AO\perp \ell$, we have $AM = R-OM = 4$.

\par Now set $P = AB\cap\ell$ and $Q=AC\cap\ell$.  Remark that the fact that $AO\perp\ell$ gives that $\triangle APQ\sim\triangle ACB$.  Since $\omega$ is the $A$-excircle of $\triangle APQ$, we thus get that the ratio of similitude of the two triangles is $r_a/r$.  As a result, since the distance from $A$ to $PQ$ is $4$, the distance from $A$ to $BC$ must be $4\tfrac{r_a}r = r_a$.
