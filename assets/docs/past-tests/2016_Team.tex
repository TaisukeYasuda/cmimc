point $\tfrac{3}{16}$ from the top and left edges, and then the paper is
completely unfolded. The holes in the unfolded paper form a rectangular array of
unevenly spaced points; when connected with horizontal and vertical line
segments, these points form a grid of squares and rectangles. Let $P$ be a point
chosen randomly from \textit{inside} this grid. Find the largest $L$ such that,
for all $n$, the probability that the four segments $P$ is bounded by form a

\item Recall that in any row of Pascal's Triangle, the first and last elements of the row are $1$ and each other element in the row is the sum of the two elements above it from the previous row.  With this in mind, define the \textit{Pascal Squared Triangle} as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item In the $n^{\text{th}}$ row, where $n\geq 1$, the first and last elements of the row equal $n^2$;

\item Each other element is the sum of the two elements directly above it.

\end{itemize}

The first few rows of the Pascal Squared Triangle are shown below.

We first make use of a lemma.

\par\textbf{LEMMA: }Let $A$ and $B$ be the points of tangency of the parabola with the $x$ and $y$ axes and $O$ the origin.  Then the focus of $\mathcal{P}$ is the projection of $O$ onto $AB$.

\par\textit{Proof. } Recall the reflection property of parabolas, which states that if $F$ is the focus of a parabola, then the reflection of $F$ about any tangent line lies on the directrix of the parabola.  With this in mind, let the reflections of $F$ about the $x$ and $y$ axes be $F_x$ and $F_y$ respectively.  Remark that by similar triangles $F_xF_y$ passes through $O$.  Furthermore, note that by the reflection property $FA=AF_x$.  But by definition a parabola is the set of points which are equidistant from the focus to the directrix, so $AF_x$ is also the distance from $A$ to $F_xF_y$, i.e. $AF_x\perp F_xF_y$.  By symmetry, therefore, $OF\perp FA$.  Similarly, $OF\perp FB$ and the result follows.

\par Unfortunately, the CMIMC staff does not have a more elegant solution past this point - we apologize for the inconvenience.  

\par Generalizing the problem, let $(a,b)$ be the focus of the parabola.  Then as a corollary of the above lemma, the directrix of the parabola is $y=-\tfrac bax$.  Now according to the Distance from Point to Line formula, we get that a point $(x,y)$ lies on $\mathcal{P}$ iff \[\sqrt{(x-a)^2+(y-b)^2}=\dfrac{|bx+ay|}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}\implies (x-a)^2+(y-b)^2=\dfrac{(bx+ay)^2}{a^2+b^2}.\] Now note that the condition of $\mathcal{P}$-friendliness equates to the existence of positive real numbers $x_0$ and $y_0$ such that $(x_0,2y_0)\in\mathcal{P}$ and $(2x_0,y_0)\in\mathcal{P}$.  As a result, it suffices to determine the sum of all possible values of $-\tfrac{y_0}{x_0}$ given that $x_0$ and $y_0$ both satisfy \[(x_0-a)^2+(2y_0-b)^2=\dfrac{(bx_0+2ay_0)^2}{a^2+b^2}\qquad\text{and}\qquad (2x_0-a)^2+(y_0-b)^2=\dfrac{(2bx_0+ay_0)^2}{a^2+b^2}.\] Note that subtracting the second equation from the first gives \[3(y_0^2-x_0^2)+2(ax_0-by_0)=\dfrac{3(a^2y_0^2-by_0^2)}{a^2+b^2}.\] Now since $(y_0^2-x_0^2)(a^2+b^2)=a^2y_0^2+b^2y_0^2-a^2x_0^2-b^2x_0^2$, we see that clearing denominators cancels several terms and leaves \[3(a^2x_0^2-b^2y_0^2)=2(ax_0-by_0)(a^2+b^2).\] Now if $ax_0=by_0$, then it's not hard to show that the original two quadratics are equivalent and thus there are two solutions to the original system - we leave this as an exercise to the reader.  Otherwise, we have $ax_0+by_0=\tfrac23(a^2+b^2)$.

\par Now adding the original two equations together gives \[5x_0^2-6x_0a+2a^2+5y_0^2-6y_0b+2b^2=\dfrac{5b^2x_0^2+8abx_0y_0+5a^2y_0^2}{a^2+b^2}.\] Note that the $ax_0+by_0$ expression appears here, and so we may substitute our known value for it to simplify the equation to \[5x_0^2+5y_0^2-2(a^2+b^2)=\dfrac{5b^2x_0^2+8abx_0y_0+5a^2y_0^2}{a^2+b^2}.\] Once again, multiply through by $a^2+b^2$ to clear denominators and simplify terms; this eventually gives \[5a^2x_0^2-8abx_0y_0+6y_0^2b^2=2(a^2+b^2)^2.\] Now squaring the equality $ax_0+by_0=\tfrac23(a^2+b^2)$ and subtracting yields $18abx_0y_0=\tfrac29(a^2+b^2)^2$, so $abx_0y_0=\tfrac1{81}(a^2+b^2)^2$.

\par Consider the system of equations \[ax_0+by_0=\dfrac23(a^2+b^2)\qquad\text{and}\qquad (ax_0)(by_0)=\dfrac1{81}(a^2+b^2)^2.\] Letting $X=3x_0(a^2+b^2)$ and $Y=3y_0(a^2+b^2)$ does not change the ratio $\tfrac{Y}{X}$ and additionally simplifies this system to \[aX+bY=2\qquad\text{and}\qquad (aX)(bY)=\frac19.\] It is easy to solve for $X$ and $Y$ from here and compute the sum of the two possible values for $\tfrac{Y}{X}$, but we can instead be somewhat clever and note that by Vieta's if $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of the quadratic $t^2-2t+\tfrac19=0$, then the sum of the two possible values of $\tfrac{bY}{aX}$ must be \[\dfrac{r_1}{r_2}+\dfrac{r_2}{r_1}=\dfrac{r_1^2+r_2^2}{r_1r_2}=\dfrac{(r_1+r_2)^2}{r_1r_2}-2=34,\] so the sum of the (negatives of the) slopes of the two lines in this case is $34\tfrac{a}{b}$.

\par Overall, the sum of the (negatives of the) slopes of the four lines which work is \[34\cdot\dfrac{a}{b}+\dfrac{a}{b}+\dfrac{a}{b}=36\cdot\dfrac{a}{b}.\] Going back to the original problem, we see that since the line $OF$ is perpendicular to $AB$ its slope is $\tfrac{5}{12}$, meaning that $F$ lies on the line $y=\tfrac{5}{12}x$.  Therefore the sum of the slopes is $-36\cdot\tfrac{12}5=\tfrac{432}5$ and the requested answer is $\boxed{437}$.
