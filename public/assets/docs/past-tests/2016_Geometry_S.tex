\begin{enumerate}

\item Let $\triangle ABC$ be an equilateral triangle and $P$ a point on $\overline{BC}$.  If $PB=50$ and $PC=30$, compute $PA$.

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$.  The fact that $PB=50$ and $PC=30$ implies that the side length of $\triangle ABC$ is $80$, so $AM=40\sqrt 3$.  Furthermore, it is easy to deduce that $BM=10$.  Therefore by the Pythagorean Theorem \[AP^2=AM^2+MB^2=(40\sqrt3)^2+10^2=4900\quad\implies\quad AP=\boxed{70}.\]

\item Let $ABCD$ be an isosceles trapezoid with $AD=BC=15$ such that the distance between its bases $AB$ and $CD$ is $7$.  Suppose further that the circles with diameters $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ are tangent to each other.  What is the area of the trapezoid?

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Let $T$ be the point of tangency of the two circles, and let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $\overline{AD}$ and $\overline{BC}$ respectively.  Then $M$, $N$, and $T$ all lie on the same line, so \[MN=MT+TN=\frac12AD+\frac12BC = \frac12\cdot 15+\frac12\cdot 15 = 15.\] Now recall that the area of a trapezoid is $\tfrac12h(b_1+b_2)$, where $h$ is the distance between the bases of the trapezoid and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are said bases' lengths.  But recall that $MN$ is a midline of $ABCD$, meaning that its length is the average of the lengths of $AB$ and $CD$.  But this is precisely $\tfrac12(b_1+b_2)$!  Therefore the desired area is $7\cdot 15=\boxed{105}$.

\item Let $ABC$ be a triangle.  The angle bisector of $\angle B$ intersects $AC$ at point $P$, while the angle bisector of $\angle C$ intersects $AB$ at a point $Q$.  Suppose the area of $\triangle ABP$ is 27, the area of $\triangle ACQ$ is 32, and the area of $\triangle ABC$ is $72$.  The length of $\overline{BC}$ can be written in the form $m\sqrt n$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $n$ as small as possible.  What is $m+n$?

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution For ease of typesetting let $[X]$ denote the area of region $X$.  Note that $[ABP]=27$ and $[ABC]=72$ implies that $[BCP]=72-27=45$, so by the Angle Bisector Theorem \[\dfrac{AB}{BC}=\dfrac{AP}{PC}=\dfrac{[ABP]}{[BPC]}=\dfrac{27}{45}=\frac{3}{5}.\] Through a similar process one may obtain $\tfrac{AC}{BC}=\tfrac45$.  Therefore $\triangle ABC$ is a 3-4-5 right triangle with a right angle at $A$.

\par Let $AB=3x$, $AC=4x$, and $BC=5x$ for some positive real $x$.  Then by the formula for area \[\dfrac12(3x)(4x) = 72\quad\implies\quad x=\sqrt{12}=2\sqrt3.\] Thus $BC=5x=10\sqrt3$ and the requested answer is $10+3=\boxed{13}$.

\item Andrew the Antelope canters along the surface of a regular icosahedron, which has twenty equilateral triangle faces and edge length 4. (A three-dimensional image of an icosahedron is shown to the right.)

\solution Looking at the icosahedral net, it is clear that the desired length is equal to the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg equal to the height of a triangular face and the other leg equal to $\tfrac52$ of the side length of a face. Hence Pythagorean theorem yields $10^2+(2\sqrt{3})^2 = \boxed{112}$.

\item Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a parallelepiped with side lengths $x$, $y$, and $z$.  Suppose that the four space diagonals of $\mathcal{P}$ have lengths $15$, $17$, $21$, and $23$.  Compute $x^2+y^2+z^2$.

\proposed{David Altizio and Joshua Siktar}

\solution Recall the Parallelogram Law in two dimensions, which states that if $x$ and $y$ are elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ then $|x+y|^2+|x-y|^2=2(|x|^2+|y|^2)$.  (This is true by the Law of Cosines.)  I claim that this can be extended further.  Indeed, for any three dimensional vectors $x$, $y$, and $z$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$, the identity \[4(|x|^2+|y|^2+|z|^2)=|x+y+z|^2+|x+y-z|^2+|x-y+z|^2+| -x+y+z|^2\] is true.  To prove this, we use the two-dimensional version repeatedly.  Note that $0$, $x+y$, $z$, and $x+y+z$ form a parallelogram, which means that \[2(|x+y|^2+|z|^2)=|x+y+z|^2+|x+y-z|^2.\] Similarly, since $0$, $x-y$, $z$, and $x-y+z$ form a parallelogram, we have \[2(|x-y|^2+|z|^2)=|x-y+z|^2+| -x+y+z|^2.\] Adding these together yields \[2(|x+y|^2+|x-y|^2)+4|z|^2=|x+y+z|^2+|x+y-z|^2+|x-y+z|^2+| -x+y+z|^2\] and using the parallelogram law on the LHS one last time yields the desired equality.

\par Returning back to the original problem, we have \[4(x^2+y^2+z^2)=15^2+17^2+21^2+23^2=2(16^2+1)+2(22^2+1)=2(16^2+22^2) + 4,\] which means that $x^2+y^2+z^2=2(8^2+11^2)+1=\boxed{371}$.

\par\textit{Remark.} This version of the parallelogram law can be extended to hold true in all dimensions.  Formally, \[2^n\sum_{i=1}^n|z_i|^2=\sum_{(e_1,\ldots, e_n)\in\{+1,-1\}^n}\left|\sum_{i=1}^ne_iz_i\right|^2\] for vectors $z_1,\ldots,z_n\in\mathbb{R}^n$.

\item In parallelogram $ABCD$, angles $B$ and $D$ are acute while angles $A$ and $C$ are obtuse.  The perpendicular from $C$ to $AB$ and the perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$ intersect at a point $P$ inside the parallelogram.  If $PB=700$ while $PD=821$, what is $AC$?

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution First note that $P$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$.  Furthermore, note that from the perpendicularity $DA\perp AP$ and $DC\perp CP$, so quadrilateral $DAPC$ is cyclic.  Furthermore, $DP$ is a diameter of circle $(DAPC)$.  This is the circumcircle of $\triangle DAC$, which is congruent to $BCA$.  As a result, if $R$ is the circumradius of $\triangle ABC$, then $PD=2R$.

\par Now I claim that $PB=2R\cos B$.  To prove this, reflect $P$ across $AB$ to point $P'$.  It is well-known that $P'$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle ABC$, so in particular the circumradii of $\triangle APB$ and $\triangle ACB$ are equal.  But then by Law of Sines \[\dfrac{BP}{\sin\angle BAP}=\dfrac{BP}{\cos B}=2R\quad\implies\quad BP = 2R\cos B\] as desired.  (An alternate way to see this is through the diagram itself: from right triangle trigonometry on triangles $DAP$ and $DCP$ it is not hard to see that $PA=2R\cos A$ and $PC=2R\cos C$, which by symmetry suggests $PB=2R\cos B$.)

\par Finally, note that by Law of Sines again we have $AC=2R\sin B$, so \[AC^2+BP^2=(2R\sin B)^2 + (2R\cos B)^2 = (2R)^2(\sin^2 B+\cos^2 B) = PD^2.\] Hence \[AC^2=PD^2-PB^2=821^2-700^2=(821-700)(821+700)=11^2\cdot 39^2\] and so $AC=11\cdot 39=\boxed{429}$.

\item Let $ABC$ be a triangle with incenter $I$ and incircle $\omega$.  It is given that there exist points $X$ and $Y$ on the circumference of $\omega$ such that $\angle BXC=\angle BYC=90^\circ$.  Suppose further that $X$, $I$, and $Y$ are collinear.  If $AB=80$ and $AC=97$, compute the length of $BC$.

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Let $\Omega$ be the circle with diameter $\overline{AC}$.  Then $X$ and $Y$ are the intersection points of $\omega$ and $\Omega$, so $XY$ is the radical axis of $\omega$ and $\Omega$.  The condition that $X$, $I$, and $Y$ are collinear implies that $I$ lies on the radical axis of these two circles.

\par Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$ and $D$ the point of tangency of $\omega$ with $BC$.  The power of $I$ with respect to $\omega$ is $r^2$, while the power of $I$ with respect to $\Omega$ is \[MB^2-MI^2=\left(\frac a2\right)^2 - (ID^2+DM^2) = \frac{a^2}4-\left(r^2+\left(\frac a2 - (s-b)\right)^2\right)=a(s-b)-r^2-(s-b)^2.\] Setting these equal to each other yields \[2r^2 = a(s-b)-(s-b)^2 = (s-b)(a+b-s)=(s-b)(s-c).\] Now recall that Heron's Formula states $(rs)^2 = K^2 = s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)$.  Plugging in our equality from above and cancelling like mad leads to \[s=2(s-a)\quad\implies\quad a+b+c=2(b+c-a)\quad\implies\quad b+c=3a.\] Hence $BC=\tfrac{AB+AC}3=\tfrac{80+97}3=\boxed{59}$.

\item Suppose $ABCD$ is a convex quadrilateral satisfying $AB=BC$, $AC=BD$, $\angle ABD = 80^\circ$, and $\angle CBD = 20^\circ$.  What is $\angle BCD$ in degrees?

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Construct a point $X$ outside $\triangle ABC$ such that $\triangle BCD\cong\triangle AXC$.  (This can be done from the fact that $AC=BD$.)  Then from $AB=BC$ we know $\angle BAC=40^\circ$, so $\angle BAX = 40^\circ+20^\circ = 60^\circ$.  Combining this with $AX=BC=BA$ gives that $\triangle ABX$ is equilateral.

\par From here, note that $\angle CBX = \angle CBA - 60^\circ=40^\circ$, and since $\triangle CBX$ is isosceles $\angle BXC=70^\circ$.  Thus \[\angle BCD = \angle AXC = \angle BXC + \angle AXB = 70^\circ+60^\circ=\boxed{130^\circ}.\]

\item Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle with $AB=65$, $BC=70$, and $CA=75$.  A semicircle $\Gamma$ with diameter $\overline{BC}$ is erected outside the triangle.  Suppose there exists a circle $\omega$ tangent to $AB$ and $AC$ and furthermore internally tangent to $\Gamma$ at a point $X$.  The length $AX$ can be written in the form $m\sqrt{n}$ where $m$ and $n$ are positive integers with $n$ not divisible by the square of any prime.  Find $m+n$.

\proposed{David Altizio}

\solution Scale down by a factor of $5$, so that $AB=13$, $BC=14$, and $CA=15$.  Let $\kappa$ denote the incircle of $\triangle ABC$.  The key is to recognize that by Monge's Theorem (or simply composite homotheties) $AX$ passes through the exsimilicenter $P$ of $\kappa$ and $\Gamma$.  Since both of these circles are fixed, $P$ is also fixed.  Thus it suffices to determine the location of $P$ and use this to find the location of $X$.

Denote by $I$ the incenter of $\triangle ABC$ and by $M$ the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$.  Furthermore, let $I_0$ and $P_0$ be the feet of the perpendiculars from $I$ and $P$ respectively to $BC$.  We can easily compute that the radii of $\kappa$ and $\Gamma$ are $4$ and $7$ respectively, so by the definition of exsimilicenter, $\tfrac{PI}{PM}=\tfrac47$.  This in turn implies $\tfrac{P_0I_0}{P_0M}=\tfrac47$.  It is readily seen that $I_0M=1$, so therefore $P_0M=\tfrac73$.  Similar reasoning yields $P_0P=\tfrac{28}3$.

\par Briefly turn to coordinates to make conceptualization easier.  Set up a coordinate system where $M$ is the origin and $BC$ is the $x$-axis.  Then $P$ has coordinates $(-\tfrac73,\tfrac{28}3)$ and $A$ has coordinates $(-2,12)$, so the slope of line $AP$ is $8$.

\par Revert back to the Euclidean Plane.  Let $D=AX\cap BC$, and let $X_0$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $X$ to $BC$.  Set $X_0D$ to be $t$.  Then $XX_0=8t$.  Furthermore, $DM$ can be easily computed to be $\tfrac32+2=\tfrac72$ by the definition of slope.  Thus by Pythagorean Theorem on $\triangle MX_0X$, \[\left(t+\dfrac72\right)^2+(8t)^2=7^2\quad\implies\quad t=\frac7{10}.\] A few applications of the Pythagorean Theorem yield $AX=\tfrac{11\sqrt{65}}5$.  Scaling back up by a factor of $5$ yields $m=11$, $n=65$, and $m+n=\boxed{076}$.

\item Let $\triangle ABC$ be a triangle with circumcircle $\Omega$ and let $N$ be the midpoint of the major arc $\widehat{BC}$.  The incircle $\omega$ of $\triangle ABC$ is tangent to $AC$ and $AB$ at points $E$ and $F$ respectively.  Suppose point $X$ is placed on the same side of $EF$ as $A$ such that $\triangle XEF\sim\triangle ABC$.  Let $NX$ intersect $BC$ at a point $P$.  If $AB=15$, $BC=16$, and $CA=17$, then compute $\tfrac{PX}{XN}$.

\solution We solve for general $a$, $b$, and $c$.  We start off by proceeding through a series of lemmas.

\par\textbf{LEMMA 1: }$AX\parallel BC$.

\begin{proof}Let $I$ be the incenter of $\triangle ABC$.  Note that since $\angle EXF=\angle EAF$, $X$ lies on the circumcircle of $\triangle AEF$.  Now remark that since \[\angle FID+\angle FIX=180^\circ-\angle B + \angle XEF=180^\circ-\angle B + \angle B = 180^\circ,\] we have $D$, $I$ and $X$ collinear, i.e. $XI\perp BC$.  Furthermore, $A$ and $I$ are antipodal with respect to $(AEF)$, so $\angle AXI=90^\circ$.  Hence $AX\parallel BC$ as desired.\end{proof}

\par\textbf{LEMMA 2: }Denote by  $Q$ the second intersection point of $\Omega$ with $(AEF)$.  Then $Q$ lies on $\overline{PN}$.

\begin{proof} Extend $AX$ to hit $\Omega$ again at $A'$.  Then $AA'CB$ is an isosceles trapezoid.  Furthermore, $N$ is the midpoint of $\widehat{AA'}$, so $\angle AQN=\angle A'QN$.

\par Now consider the spiral similarity sending $\triangle XEF$ to $\triangle A'BC$.  This spiral similarity is centered at $Q$ (a well-known fact - provable by angle chasing).  Since this spiral similarity sends $A$ to $N$ (both are midpoints of their respective arcs), we have $\triangle QAX\sim\triangle QNA'$, i.e. $\angle AQX=\angle NQA'$.  Hence $N$, $X$, and $Q$ are collinear, leading to the desired.
\end{proof}

\par\textbf{LEMMA 3:} $EF$ passes through $P$.

\begin{proof}Note that by simple angle chasing \[\angle XQF=180^\circ-\angle XEF=180^\circ-\angle ABC=\angle PBF.\] This implies that quadrilateral $PQFB$ is cyclic, so $\angle PBQ=\angle PFQ$.  But since $Q$ is the center of spiral similarity sending $EF$ to $BC$, we also have $\angle QFE=\angle QBC$.  Hence since $P$, $B$, and $C$ are collinear we must also have $P$, $E$, and $F$ collinear.  
\end{proof}

Now we compute.  Remark that by Power of a Point $PQ\cdot PX=PF\cdot PE=PD^2$ and $PQ\cdot PN=PB\cdot PC$, so \[\dfrac{XN}{PX}=\dfrac{PN}{PX}-1=\dfrac{PN\cdot PQ}{PX\cdot PQ} - 1 = \dfrac{PB\cdot PC}{PD^2}-1.\] To compute $PB$, remark that by either Menelaus or harmonic divisions we may obtain $\tfrac{PB}{PC}=\tfrac{DB}{DC}$.  Since $BD=s-b$ and $CD=s-c$, it is easy to find that $PB=\tfrac{a(s-b)}{b-c}$.  This means that $PC=\tfrac{a(s-c)}{b-c}$ and \[PD=\dfrac{a(s-b)}{b-c}+(s-b)=(s-b)\left(\dfrac{a}{b-c}+1\right)=(s-b)\left(\dfrac{a+b-c}{b-c}\right)=\dfrac{2(s-c)(s-b)}{b-c}.\] As a result, \[\dfrac{PB\cdot PC}{PD^2}=\dfrac{a^2(s-b)(s-c)/(b-c)^2}{(2(s-b)(s-c)/(b-c))^2}=\frac{a^2}{4(s-b)(s-c)}.\] Hence \[\dfrac{XN}{PX}=\dfrac{a^2}{4(s-b)(s-c)}-1=\dfrac{16^2}{4(24-15)(24-17)}-1=\dfrac{8^2}{9\cdot 7}-1=\dfrac{1}{63},\] so $\tfrac{PX}{XN}=\boxed{63}$.
