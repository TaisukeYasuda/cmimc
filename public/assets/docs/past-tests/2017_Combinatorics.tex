\item Do not look at the test before the proctor starts the round.

\item This test consists of 10 short-answer problems to be solved in 60 minutes.
	Each question is worth one point.

\item Write your name, team name, and team ID on your answer sheet. Circle the
	subject of the test you are currently taking.

\item Write your answers in the corresponding boxes on the answer sheets.

\item No computational aids other than pencil/pen are permitted.

\item Answers must be reasonably simplified.

\item If you believe that the test contains an error, submit your protest in writing to Doherty 2302 by the end of lunch.

\item Robert colors each square in an empty 3 by 3 grid either red or green. Find the number of colorings such that no row or column contains more than one green square.

\item Let $S$ be a subset of $\{1,2,\dots,2017\}$ such that for any two distinct elements in $S$, both their sum and product are not divisible by seven. Compute the maximum number of elements that can be in $S$.

\item Annie stands at one vertex of a regular hexagon. Every second, she moves independently to one of the two vertices adjacent to her, each with equal probability. Determine the probability that she is at her starting position after ten seconds.

\item At a certain pizzeria, there are five different toppings available and a pizza can be ordered with any (possibly empty) subset of them on it. In how many ways can one order an unordered pair of pizzas such that at most one topping appears on both pizzas and at least one topping appears on neither?

\item Emily draws six dots on a piece of paper such that no three lie on a straight line, then draws a line segment connecting each pair of dots. She then colors five of these segments red. Her coloring is said to be \emph{red-triangle-free} if for every set of three points from her six drawn points there exists an uncolored segment connecting two of the three points. In how many ways can Emily color her drawing such that it is red-triangle-free?

\item Boris plays a game in which he rolls two standard four-sided dice independently and at random, and at the end of the game receives a number of dollars equal to the product of the two rolled numbers. After the initial roll of both dice, however, he can pay two dollars to reroll one die of choice, and he is allowed to pay to reroll as many times as he wishes. If Boris plays to maximize his expected gain, how much money, in dollars, can he expect to win by playing once?

\item Given a finite set $S \subset \mathbb{R}^3$, define $f(S)$ to be the mininum integer $k$ such that there exist $k$ planes that divide $\mathbb{R}^3$ into a set of regions, where no region contains more than one point in $S$. Suppose that
\[M(n) = \max\{f(S) : \abs{S} = n\} \text{ and } m(n) = \min\{f(S) : \abs{S} = n\}.\]
Evaluate $M(200) \cdot m(200)$.

\item Andrew generates a finite random sequence $\{a_n\}$ of distinct integers according to the following criteria:
\begin{itemize}
\item $a_0 = 1$, $0 < \abs{a_n} < 7$ for all $n$, and $a_i \neq a_j$ for all $i < j$.
\item $a_{n+1}$ is selected uniformly at random from the set $\{a_n - 1, a_n + 1, -a_n\}$, conditioned on the above rule. The sequence terminates if no element of the set satisfies the first condition.
\end{itemize}
For example, if $(a_0, a_1) = (1, 2)$, then $a_2$ would be chosen from the set $\{-2,3\}$, each with probability $\tfrac12$. Determine the probability that there exists an integer $k$ such that $a_k = 6$.

\item At a conference, six people place their name badges in a hat, which is shaken up; one badge is then distributed to each person such that each distribution is equally likely. Each turn, every person who does not yet have their own badge finds the person whose badge they have and takes that person's badge. For example, if Alice has Bob's badge and Bob has Charlie's badge, Alice would have Charlie's badge after a turn. Compute the probability that everyone will eventually end up with their own badge.

\item Ryan stands on the bottom-left square of a 2017 by 2017 grid of squares, where each square is colored either black, gray, or white according to the pattern as depicted to the right. Each second he moves either one square up, one square to the right, or both one up and to the right, selecting between these three options uniformly and independently. Noting that he begins on a black square, find the probability that Ryan is still on a black square after 2017 seconds.

%\item A positive integer $n$ is called \emph{agreeable} if there exists an integer $k$ such that \[\abs{n - k^2} = 100.\] Find the number of agreeable integers less than 2017.

%\item Let $S$ be a subset of the integers containing zero such that, for any $k \in S$, we have that $2k+1 \in S$ and $8k+1 \in S$. Compute the smallest possible number of non-negative integers in $S$ less than 2017.

%\item A misguided psychic plays a game against an infinitely wealthy enemy. A coin is tossed, and both players simultaneously guess the result of the coin flip; if they guess differently, then the correct guesser takes a token from the other person. The psychic begins with three tokens and can guess the coin flip correctly with probability $p$. If the enemy guesses at random each time, find the probability that the psychic will eventually lose all his tokens.

%\item Let $S$ be the set $\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, and let $A=\{1,2,3,4\}$ and $B=\{3,4,5\}$.  Determine the number of functions $f:S\to S$ such that \[f(A\cap B) = f(A)\cap f(B).\] Here, for any set $T\subset S$, $f(T) = \{f(t):t\in T\}$.
